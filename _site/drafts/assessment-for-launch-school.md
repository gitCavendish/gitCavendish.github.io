My real name is Xulelong(Chinese Pinyin), and I take Xullnn as my English name.

- Your education and professional background, and particularly any prior programming experience.

I got my master's degree in [Landscape Architecture] from an university in China.

After graduation, I got a profressionally related job in Chengdu, China. But three months later, the company paid nothing, and most people there talked a lot about office politics, so I left the company, with several others.

In the two subsequent years, I tried hardly to find a job that was 'just fine'. But I failed. All the jobs I did were dabbling various things and softwares, I found myself learnt so few. Meanwhile, many of my classmates changed to other occupations. My families suggest that maybe I should go get a job as a civil servant which regarded as a safe choice in this country, after all--in their words--I'm not young anymore. At some point, I almost followed this advice. Nevertheless I didn't. I quit my job, back to my hometown, working at my family's business.

Accidentally, I read a book about English. The author told many advantages about learning English, even though you can just read in English(Yeah, I almost cannot read in English although I have a master's degree. That's embarassing). So I began to study English everyday. I keep reciting TOEFL vocabularies, reading English books, shadowing Ted talks. That's not easy, especially at the beginning. I still remember that it took me 8 hours in 3 days to follow a TOEFL listening material which has only about 150 words. But I was so desperate to quit, this was the only thing I konw it's right for me. So I sticked to my learning schedule, keep learning English the hard way. About a year later I found I progress a lot. Then a serendipity came in.

By learning English, I expanded my vision. I found there are much more great books, learning resources around English world than there are in China. I found programming was a good subject to learn, not only because it would be a promised profession in the future, but also it involves so many disciplines and is fun, besides I can learning English and programming simultaneously. So I joined a online fullstack code camp in China, which by the way, I had no idea about what is 'fullstack' at that time. The whole course last for 3 months, and had no limit about how much time you must put in.
The ad said that by taking this course, from a total novice, you would become a junior fullstack developer and own the ability to build awesome websites. Without hesitation, I jumped in.

I bought a Mac, for the very first time , I began to study programming. Its pedagogy is at the beginning you must follow the instruction step by step, then repeating enough times at every phase. Don't ask why, don't doubt the process. Rails is the core of the course, after setting up development environment, we began to use Rails„ÄÅBootstrap and Github directly. At the elementary phase, we were asked to follow the instruction that guided us to build a simple static website by using Rails, then repeat this process at least 3 times. Then you can move to the next phase, again, same process, just a more complex Rails app. There has no 'why' and 'what' in the instruction, all you have to do is coding and repeating, at the intervals of different phases, it taught you some coding knowledge about ruby, Rails, and some front-end things.

The final phase is to build a shopping website. After finishing the shopping website, we were asked to find another peer mate to form a team. There's a final assessment--a competition of building shopping website, based on all the things we had learned. Every team got about 2 weeks to build its own app, and you must collaborate with your teammate though github remotely. Most of us felt excited while some felt they totally could not followed the pace. Me? I may belonged to the mixed one, on the one hand I was excited about that I had learned so much and the way we collaborated was amazing, on the other hand I felt it's hard for me to transform the knowledge to my own idea. Ironically, I even didn't know the difference between Rails and Ruby until the final phase, actually I couldn't build anything without Rails. But I had no idea about my situation.

Unexpectedly, a student published a beautiful website just the next day. It looks so well-structured, so organized, and so professional. Then I thought I was a total fool, in the past 24 hours I just made a few adjustments based on the instruction. Within several days, many had published their apps, some were good, some were not so good. My teammate and I finished our first version after approximate 10 days later. Although our app looked pretty well and received many praises, but most students had voted to others, we just got few votes. Not surprisingly, the team which firstly published its app won the competition. And that was the end of the offical curriculum. Teams who had the high votes got the chances to be recommended jobs, but it turned out that only few of them got a job as formal developer.

I wondered why we followed same course, but got so different results. Later I realized some top students were not totally new to programming, some of them had some experience before, some of them had the CS related degree. Also, students who did so well had put much more time in this project than others. If you had a full job and only had 2 or 3 hours for training per day, it's hard to learn well than others. There's no magic, neither programming genius. Comparing the learning experience in this camp with my previous learning story, I realized all the skiils I learned well and brought me confidence were the skills I learned strenuously and consistently, such as Tennis, Snooker, English.

Although I didn't become a fullstack developer, but I do fall in love with programming. So I started to teach myself. In order to underpin the foundation I joined some online programming websites such as treehouse, codeschool. I read books about Ruby, about Rails, about Algorithms, about Testing, about Js, about database, about html and css. I followed every code example in these books, read some of them twice, I even bought living books that I can read the book out loud so I could learning programming and English simultaneously. But soon I found there were so many things to learn, I felt overwhelmed. I may know some about Rails, but there are so many other frameworks out there, I may know some about Algorithms, but it seemed I probably need more mathematic knowledge to absorb more, whether I should read some CS books? What about design patterns? The more I had learned, the more I felt confused. It feels 10 years might not be enough for me to master any of them. I realised I was just dabbling these different subjects  around and it's not the right path of learning programming. I need professional mentor to tell me what to learn and how to learn. So I began my seeking online. I noticed some code schools have a job guarantee, that's great, so I checked their curriculum, it looks good and familiar. The curriculum overlapped many subjects I had learned. Could they let me master these subjects just in 3~6 months? Based on my experience, probably not.

- How you found Launch School.

While I was looking for a good coding school, I found Launch School. I read the pedagogy, I felt strong resonance. I have read many books about cognitive psychology and learning methodology, so I am sure that Launch school's pedagogy is more scientific and practical.

- What your impression was of the Prep courses you just completed. Which parts were easy for you and which parts were difficult? What did you enjoy, and what did you not like about it?

The prep courses include many topics, although it's basic, but it still helped me clarified some concepts. I think topics about Ruby, Command line, Github are relatively easy for me since I used to learn them. The reading tasks took me more time to finish because English is not my first language. I woundn't say it's hard but it did take me more time, and those are great books.

- How long did it take you to complete the Prep courses end to end?

About 2 months.
