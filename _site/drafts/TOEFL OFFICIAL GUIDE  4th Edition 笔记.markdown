This Offical Guide has been created to help English language learners understand the TOEFL test and prepare for it.By preparing for the test,you will also be building the skills you need to succeed in an academic seting and go anywherr in your career,and in life.

The toefl test measure how well test takers ***use*** English,not just their knowledge of the language.

---
###Who creates the toefl test?

ETS(Educational Testing Service)is the nonprofit education organization that develops and administer the TOEFL test.

---

Often, your field of study and whether you are applying as a graduate or undergraduate student will determine what TOEFL scires you need.

---

###Is there a Minimum Acceptable Score?

These minimums vary from one instution to another,depending on factors such as the applicant's field of study,the level of study(undergraduate or graduate),whether the applicant will be a teaching assistant,and whether the instutition offers English as a Second Language support for its students.

---

Because the toefl test is designed to assess the actual skills you will need to be successful in your studies,the very best way to develop the skills being measured is to study in an English program that focuses on:

* communication using all four skills,especially speaking
* ***integrated*** skills(for example,listening/edading/speaking,listening/reading/writing)

---


The best way to improve reading skills is to read frequently and to read many different types of texts in various subject areas(sciences,social sciences,arts,business,and others).

It is best to progress to reading texts that are more academic in style,the kind that would be found in university courses.

---

###In addition,you might try these activities:

* Scan the passage to find and highlight key facts and information.
* Increase vocabulary knowledge,perhaps by using flashcards.
* Rather than carefully reading each word and each sentence,practice skimming a passage quickly to get a general impression of the main idea.
* Choose some unfamiliar wors in the passage and guess the meanings from the context(surrounding sentences).
* Select all the pronouns(he,him,they,them,and others)and identify which nouns each one refers to in the passage.
* Practice making inferences and drawing conclusions based on what is implied in the passage as a whole.

##1.7 Test Preparation Tips from ETS-ETS给予的考试准备建议

 Once you have built your skills and practiced, you will be ready for the TOEFL test. Here are some good test-taking strategies recommended by ETS-如果你已经完成练习并构建了自己的技能，你就已经准备好了参加托福考试，这里有一些ETS推荐的考试策略：

 * **Carefully follow the directions** in each section to aviod wasting time.
小心的跟上每一步的指令，避免浪费时间。

* **Click on Help** to review the directions **only when absolutely necessary** because the test clock will not stop when the Help function is being used.
只在十分必要的情况下使用“Help”键来回看指导语，因为在使用此功能时，计时并不会停止。

* **Do not panic**.Concentrate on the current question only, and do not think about how you answered other questions. This is habit that can be learned through practice.
不要慌张。专注于当前的题目，不要不断回想你是怎样回答其他问题的。在平时注意的时候就应该察觉和避免这种习惯。

* **Avoid spending too much time on any one question.** If you have given the question some thought and you still do not know the answer, eliminate as many answer choices as possible and the select the best remainning choice. You can review your responses in the Reading section by clicking on Review. However, it is best to do this only after all the questions have been answered so you stay focused and save time.
避免在一道题上花费太多时间。如果你已经思考了一段时间而仍然没得出答案，排除掉不可能的答案再选择一个剩下的答案。在阅读考试部分你可以通过按“Review”键回看自己的答案，但最好是在你已经回答完所有问题后再回过来检查，以此来保证答题过程中的专注同时也更节约时间。

* **Pace yourself** so you have enough time to answer every question. Be aware of the time limit for every section/task, and budget enough time for each question/task so you do not have to rush at the end. You can hide the time clock if you wish, but it is a good idea to check the clock periodecally to monitor progress. The clock will automatically alert you when 5 minutes remain in the Listening and Reading sections, as well as in the independent and integrated tasks in the Writing section.
控制好答题节奏确保自己有充足的答题时间。保持对每一部分答题时间的感知，作好每一部分的时间预算以免在最后时刻慌乱答题。你可以根据自己的意愿隐藏时钟，但是最好定期检视时间进度。在听力和口语部分结束前的五分钟会给出提示，同样也会在写作部分的独立写作与综合写作中提醒你。

###Basic Information and Inferencing Questions-题型分类说明-基本信息与推断类问题题型

####Type 1:Factual Information Questions-题型1：事实信息提取

These questions ask you to identify factual information that is explicitly stated in the passage. Factual Information questions can focus on facts, details, definitions, or other information presented by the author. They ask you to identify specific information that is typically mentioned only in part of the passage. They generally do not ask about general themes that the passage as a whole discusses. Often, the relevant information is in one or two sentences.
这类问题要求你识别文章中明确提到的事实信息。事实信息包括事实、细节、定义、或者作者陈述的其他信息。这类特定信息会在某一段中被提到，通常这类问题不会问题你整篇文章的一般性主题，相关信息通常在文章中的一两个句子中。

***How to Recognize Fatual Information Questions-如何识别出事实信息提取类问题***
Factual Information questions are often phrased in one of these ways:-这类问题一般以以下方式提出：

>* According to the paragraph, which of the following is true of X?------------根据文章，以下关于X的说法那个为真？
* The author's description of X mentions which of the following?---------以下那个关于X的描述是作者在文中提到的？
* According to the paragraph, X occurred because...---------------------------------根据文章，X的存在/发生是因为...
* Accoding to the paragraph,X did Y because...---------------------------------------根据文章，X做Y的原因是...
* According to the paragraph,why did X do Y?----------------------------------------------根据文章，为什么X会做Y？
* The author's description of X mentions which of the following?---------作者关于X的描述在以下那个选项中被提到？


***Tips for Factual Information Questions***

* You may need to refer back to the passage in order to know what exactly is said about the subject of the question. Since the question may be about a detail, you may not recall the detail from your first reading of the passage.
你可能需要通过再次查看文章以确认问题到底在问什么，因为问题有可能是关于一个细节的，而你在第一次阅读时不太可能记住所有细节。

* Eliminate choices that present information that is contradicted in the passage.
排除与文中描述信息相悖的选项。

* Do not select an answer just because it it mentioned in the passage.Your choice should answer the specific question that was asked.
不要仅仅因为文章中曾提及一些内容就选择与之相关的选项。作出选择前一定要明确问题问到的具体问题是什么。


>**Example**
>>**PASSAGE EXCERPT:**"...Sculptures must, for example, be stable, which requires an understanding of the properties of mass, weight distribution, and stress. Paintings must have rigid stretchers so that the canvas will be taut, and the paint must not deteriorate, crack, or discolor. These are problems that must be overcome by the artist because they tend to intrude upon his or her conception of the work. For example, in the early Italian Renaissance, bronze statues of horses with a raised foreleg usually had a cannonball under that hoof. This was done because the cannonball was needed to support the weight of the leg. In other words, the demands of the laws of physics, not the sculptor's aesthetic intentions, placed the ball there. That this device was a necessary structural compromise is clear from the fact that the cannonball quickly disappeared when sculptors learned how to strengthen the internal structure of a statue with iron braces(iron being much stronger than bronze)..."

>>>According to paragraph 2, sculptors in the Italian Renaissance stopped using cannonballs in bronze statues of horse because

>>>A. they began using a material that made the statues weightless
B. they found a way to strengthen the statues internally                      **▼**
C. the aesthetic tastes of the public had change over time
D. the cannonballs added too much weight to the statues


####Type 2:Negative Factual Information Questions-题型2：反事实信息推断

These questions ask you to verify what information is true and what information is NOT true or not included in the passage based on information that is explicitly stated in the passage. To answer this kind of question, first locate the revelant information in the passage. Then verify that three of the four answer choices are true and that the remaining choice is false. Remember, for this type of question, the correct answer is the one that is NOT true.
这类问题要求你根据文章内容判断选项的对错,回答此类问题先要找到文中相关内容的位置，然后用排除法排除三个与文章内容相符的选项，剩下的一个就是正确答案。

***How to Recognize Negative Factual Information Questions***-如何识别反事实推断类题目

You can recognize negative fact questions because the word "NOT" or "EXCEPT" appears in the question in capital letters.
你可以通过识别这类问题通过查找题目中有没有大写的“NOT”和“EXCEPT”

* According to the passage, which of the following is **NOT** true of X?
* The author's description of X mentions all of the following **EXCEPT**...

>***Tips for Negative Factual Information Questions***-应对反事实推断题的建议

>>* Usually a Negative Factual Information question requires you to check more of the passage than a Factual Information question. The three choices that are mentioned in the passage may be spread across paragraph or several paragraphs.
通常此类问题需要你更多的检视文章，因为需要排除的三个选项可能跨段落存在。
* In Negetive Factual Information questions, the correct answer either directly contradicts one or more statements in the passage or is not mentioned in the passage at all.
正确的选项中的描述有可能与文章描述内容矛盾，也有可能根本没有在文中提及。
* After you finish a Negative Factual Informatio question, check your answer to make sure you have accurately understood the task.
此类题需要谨慎和更多的检查。

**Example**

>**PASSAGE EXCERPT:**"The United States in the 1800s was full of practical, hardworking people who did not consider the arts——from theater to painting——useful occupations.In addition, the public's attitude that European art was better than Ameirican art both discouraged and infuriated American artists. In the early 1900s there was a strong feeling among artists that the United States was long overdue in developing art that did not reproduce European traditions. Everybody agreed that the heart and soul of the new country should be reflected in its art. But opinions differed about what this art would be like and how it would develop."

>>According to paragraph 1, all of the following were true of American art in the late 1800s and early 1900s EXCEPT:

>>A. Most Americans thought art was unimportant.
B. American art generally copied European styles and traditions.
C. Most Americans considered American art inferior to European art.
D. American art was very popular with European audiences.**▼**



####Type 3:Inference Questions-题型3：推断性问题

These questions measures your ability to comprehend an argument or an idea that is strongly implied but not explicity stated in the text. For example, if an effect is cited in the passage, an Inference question might ask about its cause. If a comparison is made, an Inference question might ask for the basis of the comparision. You should think about not only the explicit meaning of the author's words but also the logical implications of those words.
这类题目检测你理解文章中没有明确陈述且隐藏较深的含义的能力。例如，文章引用了某种效应，然后问你引起这种效应的原因。如果是在做比较，可能会问你比较的基础是什么。回答这类问题你不能光看明确描述的文字，还要考虑文字中的**隐含逻辑**。

***How to Recognize Inference Questions***
Inference questions will usually include the word ***infer, suggest, or imply.***
推断类问题一般包含 ***infer, suggest, imply*** 这些词

* Which of the following can be inferred about X ?--------------------------------------以下那个选项可以从X中推出？
* The author of the passage implies that X ...---------------------------------------------------文章作者隐含地指出X...
* Which of the following can be inferred from paragraph 1 about X ?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------下列关于X的选项那个可以从段落1的隐含意思中推出？


>***Tips for Inference Questions***-推断类问题建议
>>* Make sure your answer dose not contradict the main idea of the passage.
确保你的答案不与文章主旨矛盾
* Do not choose ananswer just because it seems important or ture. The correct answer must be inferable from the passage.
不要因为一个答案看上去重要或真实就选它。正确答案是要从文章中推断出的。
* You should be able to defend your choice by pointing to explicitly stated information in the passage that Leads to the inference you have selected.
你明确知道文中那些内容可以支持你的推断和选项。





>**Example**
>>**PASSAGE EXCERPT**:"...The nineteenth century brought with it a burst of new discoveries and inventions that revolutionized the candle industry and **made lighting available to all**. In the early-to-mid-nineteenth century, a process was developed to refine tallow(fat from animals) with alkali and sulfuric acid. The result was a product called stearin. Stearin is harder and burns longer than unrefined tallow. This breakthrough meant that it was possible to make tallow candles that would not produce the usual smoke and rancid odor. Stearins wre also derived form palm oils, so vegetable waxes as well as animal fats could be used to make candles..."

>>>Which of the following can be inferred from paragraph 1 about candles before the nineteenth century?
A. They did not smoke when they wre burned.
B. They produced a pleasant odor as they burned.
C. They were not available to all. **▼**
D. They contained sulfuric acid.

####Type 4: Rhetorical Purpose Questions-题型4：修辞目的类问题

Rhetorical is the art of speaking or writing effectively. In Factual Information questions you are asked what information an author has presented. In Rhetorical Purpose questions you are asked why the author has presented a particular piece of information in a particular place or manner. Rhetorical Purpose questions ask you to show that you understand the rhetorical function of a statement or paragraph as it relates to the rest of the passage.
Sometimes you will be asked to identify how one paragraph relates to another. For instance, the second paragraph may give examples to support a statement in the first paragraph. The answer choices may be expressed in general terms (for example,"a theory is explained and then illustrated") or in terms that are specific to passage. ("The author explains the categories of adaptation to deserts by mammals and then gives an example.")
A Rhetorical purpose question may also ask why the author quotes a certain person or why the author mentions a particular piece of information (Example:Why does the author mention"the ability to grasp a pencil"?) Correct answer: It is an example of a motor skill developed by children at 10 to  11 monthes of age.)
修辞是一种有效表达的艺术。在事实信息类问题中你被问到作者陈述了怎样的信息。而在修辞目的类问题中你会被问到文章中的某一片段信息为什么会以特别的方式出现。修辞目的类题目要求你理解该修辞在文章段落中的作用以及它与下文有什么关联。
有时会要求你识别段落之间的联系。更进一步的说，第二段中可能会给出某一陈述来支持第一段中的观点。答案选项的一般形式是（a theory is explained and then illustrated-某一理论首先被阐述然后举例证明）或者以一种具体而直白的形式在段落中呈现。（The author explains the categories of adaptation to deserts by mammals and then gives an example-作者首先解释哺乳动物对沙漠的适应性分类然后给出例子）


***How to Recognize Rhetorical Purpose Questions***-如何识别修辞目的类题目
These are examples of the way Rhetorical Purpose questions are typically worded:
此类题目的典型描述是：

* The author discusses X in paragraph 3 in order to ...----------------------------------作者在第三段中讨论X的目的是...
* Why dose the author mention X ?------------------------------------------------------------------作者为什么提到X ?
* The author uses X as an example of...-----------------------------------------------------------作者把X当做....的例子



>***Tips for Rhetorical Purpose Questions***-修辞目的类题目建议
>>Know the definitions of these words or phrase, which are often used to describe different kinds of rhetorical purposes: "definition, example, to illustrate, to explain, to contrast, to refute, to criticize, function of ."
知道这些常用于不同修辞目的的单词或词组含义：“defination定义， example例如， to illustrate用以证明， to explain用于解释， to contrast用以比较， to refute用以驳斥， to criticize用来批判， function of 作用是...”

Rhetorical Purpose questions usually do not ask about the overall organization of the reading passage. Instead, they typically focus on the logical links between sentences and paragraphs.
修辞目的类问题通常不着眼于文章的整体构架，而是聚焦于句子和段落之间的逻辑联接。

**Example**

PASSAGE EXCERPT:“...Sensitivity to physical laws is thus an important condideration for the maker of applied-art objects. It is often taken for granted that this is also true for the maker of fine-art objects. This assumption misses a significant defference between the two disciplines. Fine-art objects are not constrained by the laws of physics in the same way that applied-art objects are. Because their primary purpose is not functional, they are only limited in terms of the material used to make them, Sculptures must, for example, be stable, which requires an understanding of the properties of mass, weight distribution, adn stress. Paintings must have rigid stretchers so that the vanvas will be taut, and the paint must not deteriorate, crack, or discolor. These are problems that must be overcome by the artist because they tend to intrude upon his or her conception of the work. For example, in the early Itanlian Renaissance, bronze statues of horses with a raised foreleg usually had a cannonball under that hoof. This was done because the cannonball was needed to support the weight of the leg...”

Why does the author discuss the "bronze statues of horses" created by artists in the early Itanlian Renaissance?
A. To provide an example of a problem related to the laws of physics that a fine artist must overcome    **▼**提供一个优秀的艺术家必须克服一些相关的物理上的难题的例证。
B. To argue that fine artists are unconcerned with the laws of physics
C. To contrast the relative sophistication of modern artists in solving problems related to the laws of physics
D. To note an exceptional piece of art constructed without the aid of technology


####Type 5: Vocabulary Questions-词汇题
These questions ask you to indentify the meanings of individual words and phrases as they are used in the reading passage(a word might have more than one meaning, but in the reading passage, only one of those meanings is relevant.) Vocabulary that is tested actually occurs in the passage; there is no "list of words" that must be tested. Usually a word or phrase is chosen to be tested as a vocabulary question because understanding that word or phrase is important to understanding a large or important part of the passage. On the TOEFL test, some words in the passage that are unusual, are technical, or have special meanings in the context of the topic are defined for you. If you click on the hyperlinked word in the passage, adefinition will appear in a box. In this book, words of this type are defined at the end of the pasaage. Naturally, words that are tested as vocabulary questions are not defined for you.
这类问题要求你理解一个单独的词或词组在文中的确切含义（一个单词通常会有很多含义，但在文章的语境中只会有一种确切含义）。考察的词汇是文章中使用的词汇，所以不会有必考的词汇清单。通常一个词汇子之所以被考到是因为对它的理解对文章大意的理解有重要意义。在托福考试中，有些词是不常用的、技术性的、或者在文章背景中有着特殊的含义。如果你点击文章中给定词的超链接，将会弹出该词的含义，在这本书中，这类词的定义在段落的结束处，当然，与考题相关的词汇不会给出你相应的定义链接。


***How to Recognize Vocabulary Questions***-如何识别词汇题
Vocabulary questions are usually easy to identify. You will see one word or phrase highlighted in the passage. You are then asked a question like any of the following:
词汇题很容易识别。你将会在段落中看到高亮标记的词或词组。然后你会被问到此类问题：

* The word "X" in the passage is closest in meaning to ...---------------------------"X"在段落中的意思最接近以下哪项
* The phrase "X" in the passage is closest in meaning to ...-----------------------------------词组“X”的意思最接近...
* In stating X, the author means that ...--------------------------------------------------------X的表述，作者的意思是...

>***Tips for Vocabulary Quesitons***

>>* Remember that the quesiton is not just asking the meaning of a word; it is asking for the meaning as it is used in the passage. Do not choose an answer just because it can be a correct meaning of the word; understand which meaning the author is using in the passage.
* Reread the sentence in the passage, substituting the word or phraze you have chosen. Confirm that the sentence still makes sense in the context of the whole passage.

**Examples**

>**PASSAGE EXCERPT:** "In the animal world the task of moving about is fulfilled in many ways. For some animals locomation is accomplished by changes in body shape ... "

>>The word "locomotion" in the passage is closest in meaning to

>>A. evolution
B. movement  **▼**
C. survival
D. escape



>**PASSAGE EXCERPT:** "Some poisonous snake bites need to be treated immediately or the victim will suffer paralysis ..."

>>In stating that the victim will "suffer paralysis中风，瘫痪" the author means that the victim will

>>A. lose the ability to move **▼**
B. become unconscious
C. undergo shock
D. feel great pain


####Type 6: Reference Questions-题型6：指代问题

These questions ask you to identify referential relationships between the word in the passage. Often, the relationship is between a pronoun and its antecedent(the word to which the pronoun refers). Sometimes other kinds of grammatical reference are tested (like which or this).
这类问题要求你识别文章中的指代关系。通常，这种关系是一个代词和他的所指的主体之间的。有时也会有其他语法类指代问题的考察。

***How to Recognize Reference Questions***-如何识别指代类问题

Reference questions look similar to vocabulary questions. In the passage, one word or phrase is highlighted. Usually the word is a pronoun. Then you are asked:
指代类问题有点类似词汇题。代词会在文中高亮标出，然后这样问你：

* The word "X" in the passage refers to ...-“X”--------------------------------------------------这个词在文中指代...

The four answer choices will be words or phrases from the passage. The highlighted word or phrase refer to only one of the choices.
四个选项是从文章中提取出的句子或词组，只有一个是正确答案。

>***Tips for Reference Questions***-指代问题建议

>>* If the Reference questions is about a pronoun, make sure your answer is the same number(singular or plural) and case(first person, second person, third person) as the highlighted pronoun.
如果是关于一个代词的问题，那么首先要看选项中的单复数形式和格形式是否与代词对应无误。
* Substitute your choice for the highlighted word or words in the sentence. Dose it violate any grammar rules? Does it make sense?
用你选择的选项去替换代词，看下替换后是否存在语法冲突，或者是否能在语义和文章内容上说得通。


**Examples**

>**PASSAGE EXCERPT:** "...These laws are universal in their application, regardless of cultural beliefs, geography, or climate. If pots have no bottoms or have large openings in their sides, they could hardly be considered containers in any traditional sense. Since the laws of physics, not some arbitrary decision, have determined the general form of applied-art objects, ***they*** follow basic patterns, so much so that functional forms can vary only within certain limits..."

>>The word "they" in the passage refers to
A. applied-art objects**▼**
B. the laws of physics
C. containers
D. the sides of pots

>**PASSAGE EXCERPT:** "... The first weekly newspaper in the colonies was the Boston Gazette, established in 1719, the same year that marked the appearance of Philadelphia's first newspaper, the American Mercury, where the young Benjamin Franklin worked. By 1760 Boston had 4 newspapers and 5 other printing establishments; Philadelphia, 2 newspapers and 3 other presses; and New York, 3 newspapers. The distribution, if not the sale, of newspapers was assisted by the establishment of a postal service in 1710, ***which*** had a network of some 65 offices by 1770, serving all 13 colonies..."

>>The word "which" in the passage refers to
A. distribution
B. sale
C. newspaper
D. postal service**▼**


>**PASSAGE EXCERPT:** "...Roots anchor the plant in one of two ways or sometimes by a conbination of the two. The first is by occupying a large volume of shallow soil around the plant's base with a fibrous root system, one consisting of many thin, profusely branched roots. Since these kinds of roots grow relatively close to the soil surface, they effectively control soil erosion. Grass roots are especially well suited to ***this purpose***. Fibrous roots capture water as it begins to percolate into the ground and so must draw their mineral supplies form the surface soil before the nutrients are leached to lower levels..."

>>The phrase"this purpose" in the passage refers to
A. combining two root systems
B. feeding the plant
C. preventing soil erosion**▼**
D. leaching nutrients

####Type 7: Sentence Simplification Questions-句子简化题

In this type of question you are asked to choose a sentence that has the same essential meaning as a sentence that occurs in the passage. Not every reading set includes a Sentence Simplification question. There is never more than one in a set.
这类题目要求你从选项中选出一个能够对应文中标记句子的必要信息的表述，这类题目在每一段阅读题中不会超过一道。


***how to Recognize Sentence Simplification Questions***-如何识别句子简化类题目

Sentence Simplification questions always look the same. A single sentence in the passage is highlight. You are then asked:
句子简化类题目通常看起来一样，文中对应的句子将被高亮标记。你会被问到：

* Which of the following best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence? Incorrect answer choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information.
下列哪一个选项表达出了标记句子的必要信息。错误的答案改变了句子的主意或省略了一些必要信息。

>***Tips for Sentence Simplification Questions***-句子简化类题目建议

>>* Make sure you understand both ways a choice can be incorrect:确保你理解错误选项的两种类型：
   * It contradicts something in the highligted sentence.------------------------与标记句子的某些意思矛盾
   * It leaves out something important from the highlighted sentence.---------------省略了一些重要信息
* Make sure your answer does not contradict the main argument of the paragraph in which the sentence occurs, or the passsage as a whole.确保你选择的句子含义与文章主旨保持一致。


**Example**
>PASSAGE EXCERPT: " ...Although we now tend to refer to the various crafts according to the materials used to construct them——clay, glass, wood, fiber, and metal——it was once common to think of crafts in terms of function, which led to their being known as the "applied arts." Approaching crafts from the point of view of function, we can divide them into simple categories: containers, shelters, and supports. There is no way around the fact that containers, shelters, and supports must be functional. The applied arts are thus bound by the laws of physics, which pertain to both the materials used in their making and the substances and things to be contained, supported, and sheltered. These laws are universal in their application, regardless of cultural beliefs, geography, or climate. If a pot has no bottom or has large openings in its sides, it could hardly be considered a contaniner in any traditional sense.***Since the laws of physics, not some arbitrary decision, haver determine the general form of applied-art objects, they follow basic patterns, so much so that functional forms can vary only within certain limits.*** Buildings without roofs, for example, are unusual because they depart from the norm. However, not all functional objects are exactly alike; that is why we recognize a Shang Dynasty vase as being different form an Inca vase. What varies is not the basic form but the incidental details that do not obstruct the object's primary function..."

>>Which of the following best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence? Incorrect answer choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information.

>>A. Functional applied-art objects cannot vary much from the basic patterns determined by the laws of physics.**▼**
B. The function of applied-art objects is determined by basic patterns in the laws of physics.
C. Since functional applied-art objects vary only within certain limits, arbitary decisions cannot have determined their general form.
D. The general form of applied-art objects is limited by some arbitrary decision that is not determined by the laws of physics.




####Type 8: Insert Text Questions-填空题

In this type of question, you are given a new sentence and are asked where in the passage it would best fit. You need to understand the logic of the passage as well as the grammatical connections (like pronoun references) between sentences.Every set includes an Insert Text question. There is never more than one in a set.
这类题目中，你会被给到一个句子，问你这句话放在文中几个给定位置中的哪里最合适。你需要理解文章的逻辑机构和认清句子间的语法连结。每个阅读题不会超过一道这类题目。

***How to Recognize Insert Text Questions***-如何识别这类问题
In the passage you will see four black squares. The squares are located at the beginnings or ends of sentences. Sometimes all four squares appear in one paragraph. Sometimes they are spread across the end of one paragraph and the beginning of another. You are then asked this question:
文中将会在某几个句子间标出四个方块。你会被问到这样的问题：

Look at the four squares [■] that indicate where the following sentence could be added to the passage.下列句子添加到文中方块所在位置是合适的。

  **[You will see a sentence in bold]**

Where would the sentence best fit?

Your job is to click on one of the squares and insert the sentence in the text.


>***Tips for Insert Text Questions***-填空题建议

>>* Try the sentence in each of the places indicated by the squares. You can place and replace the sentence as many times as you want.
尝试将句子填入每一个方块。
* Look at the structure of the sentence you are inserting. Pay special attention to connecting words; they can provide important information about where the sentence should be placed.观察你将要填入的句子，尤其是那些连接词，它们可能会提供重要信息。

>>* Frequently used connecting words:-经常使用的连词
   * On the other hand  
   * Further,  or Furthermore  
   * Similarly
   * For example
   * Therefore
   * In constrast
   * On the contrary
   * In other words
   * Finally
   * As a result
* Make sure that the inserted sentence connects logically to both the sentence before it and the sentence after it, and that any pronouns agree with the nouns they refer to.
确保填入的句子与其前后段落在逻辑上连贯，且代词之间的关系恰当无误。

**Example**
>PASSAGE EXCERPT WITH EXAMPLE SQUARES: "Scholars offer three related but different opinions about this puzzle. ■ One opinion is that the paintings were a record of the seasonal migrations made by herbs. ■ Because some paitings were made directly over others, obliterating them, it is probable that a painting's value ended with the migration the migrations were celebrated with secret ceremonies.■"

>>Look at the four squares [■] that indicate wheere the following sentence could be added to passage.

>>> **All three of them have strengths and weakness, but none adequately answers all of the questions the paintings present.**


>> Where would the sentence best fit?  **1**




###Reading to Learn Questions-阅读学习类问题

> There are two types of Reading to Learn questions: "Prose Summary" and "Fill in a Table." Reading to Learn questions require you to do more than the Basic Information questions. As you have seen, the Basic Information questions focus on your ability to understand or locate specific points in a passage at the sentence level. The Reading to Learn questions also invole:
此类问题有有两种题型：“文章总结”与“填写表格”。阅读学习类题目要求你做的比基本信息类题目更深入一些。正如你所看到的，基本信息类题目针对的更多是句子层面的具体问题，而阅读学习类问题还包含：

>>* recognizing the organization and purpose of the passage
理解文章组织构架和写作意图
* organizing the information in the passage into a **mental framework**
在头脑中形成信息的组织构架
* distinguishing rhetorical functions such as cause-effect relationships, compare-contrast relationships, arguments, and the like.
区分修辞功能与逻辑功能比如因果，对比，讨论等等。

In other words, these questions require you to demonstrate an understanding of the passage as a whole, not just specific information within it.
Reading to Learn questions require you to show that you are able not only to comprehend individual points, but also to place the major ideas and supporting information from the passage into an organizational framework or structure such as a prose summary or a table. By answering correctly, you will demonstrate that you can recognize the major points of a text, how and why the text has been organized, and the nature of the relationships within the text. Having an organized mental representation of a text is citical to learning because it allows you to remember important information from the text and apply it in new situations. If you have such a mental framework, you should be able to reconstruct the major ideas and supporting information from the text. By doing so, you will demonstrate a global understanding of the text as a whole. On the TOEFL test. each reading passage will have one Reading to Learn question. It will be either a Prose Summary or a Fill in a Table question, never both.
 换句话说，这些问题要求你对文章有一个整体的理解，而不仅仅是文中的具体信息。
 阅读学习类题目不仅仅要求你能够理解独立的观点，同样要求你能够将文章主旨和支持信息正确的归入到一个组织框架中，比如文章总结与表格。通过正确回答这类问题，你能表明你理解了文章主旨，文章的组织框架，以及文中信息的本质联系。在脑中呈现文章信息的组织构架是一个批判性学习的过程，因为这让你将文中的重要信息提取出来并在新的情境中呈现。如果你脑中有了这类组织构架，你可以重组文章的主要观点和支持信息。通过这样做，你将展示出你对文章的整体理解。在托福考试中，每一段阅读中都会有一道此类题，两种题型不会同时出现。


####Type 9: Prose Summary Questions-题型9：文章总结类题目

These questions measure your ability to understand and recognize the major ideas and the relative importance of information in a passage. You will be asked to select the major ideas in the passage by distinguishing them from minor ideas or idear that are not in the passage. The correct answer choice will synthesize major idea in the passage. Because the correct answer represents a synthesis of ideas, it will not match any particular sentence from the passage. To select the correct answer, you will need to create a mental framework to organize and remember major ideas and other important information. Understanding the relative importance of information in a passage is critical to this ability.
In a Prose Summary question, you will be given six answer choices and asked to pich the three that express the most important ideas in the passage,Unlike the Basic Information questions, each of which is worth just i point, a Prose Summary question is worth 2 points. You can earn 0 to 2 points depending on how many correct answers you choose. If you choose no correct answer or just one correct answer, you will earn no points. If you choose two correct answers, you will earn i point, If you choose all three correct answers, you will earn 2 points. The order in which you choose your answers does not matter for scoring purposes.
这些问题衡量你对文章主旨的理解和认知，要求你能区分出从文章的次要观点与无关观点，正确答案将会综合文章主要观点。由于正确答案代表着综合性的信息，所以它不会与某一单独特定的句子表达一致。为了选择正确答案，你需要构建关于文章主要观点与重要信息的精神框架。理解重要信息之间的关联是这种能力的关键。
在文章总结题型中，题目会给出6个选项让你选出3个最符合文章重要信息的选项。与基本信息类题每题只有1分不同，这类题目分值2分。基于你回答的情况可以得0-2分。如果你3个全选对，得2分，选对两个，得1分，只选对一个，得0分。选项的顺序不影响得分情况。

**Example**

Because the Prose Summary question asks you to show an understanding of the different parts of the passage, it is necessary to read the entire passage. Parts of the following passage have already been used to illustrate other question types.
由于文章总结类题目要求你展示对文章不同部分的理解情况，因此最好读完整篇文章。下面的部分段落在之前已经被用于阐释其他题型。

>**APPLIED ARTS ADN FINE ARTS**

>Although wo now tend to refer to the various crafts according to the materials used to construct them——clay, glass, wood, fiber, and metal——it was once common to think of crafts in terms of function, which led to their being known as the "applied arts."Approaching crafts from the point of view of function, we can divide them into simple categories: containers, shelters, and supports. There is no way around the fact that containers,shelters, and supports must be functional. The applied arts are thus bound by the laws of physics, which pertain to both the materials used in their making and the substances and things to be contained, supported, and sheltered. These laws are universal in their application, regardless of cultural beliefs, geography, or climate. If a pot has no bottom or has large openings in its sides, it could hardly be considered a container in any traditonal sense. Since the laws of physic, not some arbitary decision, have determined the general form of applied-art objects, they follow basic patterns, so much so that functional forms can vary only within certain limits. Buildings without roofs, for example, are unusual because they depart from the norm. However, not all functional objects are exactly alike; that is why we recognize a Shang Dynasty vase as being different from an Inca vase. What varies is not the basic form but the incidental details that do not obstruct the object's primary function.
Sensitivity to physical laws is thus an important consideration for the maker of applied-art objects. It is often taken for granted that is also true for the maker of fine-art objects. This assumption misses a significant difference between the two discipline. Fine-art objects are not constrained by the laws of physics in the same way that applied-art objects are. Because their primary purpose is not functional, they are only limited in terms of the material used to make them. Sculptures must, for example, be stable, which requires an undertanding of the properties of mass, weight distribution, and stress. Paintings must have rigid stretchers so that the canvas will be taut, and the paint must not deteriorate, crack, or discolor. These are problems that must be overcome by the artist because they tend to intrude upon his or her conception of the work. For example, in the early Italian Renaissance, bronze statues of horses with a raised foreleg usually had a connonball under that hoof. This was done because the cannonball was needed to support the weight of the leg. In other words, the demands of the laws of physics, not the sculpture's aesthetic intentions, placed the ball there. That this device was a necessary structual compromise is clear from the fact that the internal structure of a statue with iron braces(iron being much stronger than bronze).
Even though the fine arts in the twentieth century often treat materials in new ways, the basic difference in attitude of artists in relation to their materials in the fine arts and the applied arts remains relatively constant. It would therefore not be too great an exaggeration to say that practitioners of the fine arts work to overcome the limitations of their materials, whereas those engaged in the applied arts work in concert with their materials.

>>An introductory sentence for a brief summary of the passage is provided below. Complete the summary by selecting the THREE answer choices that express the most impotant ideas in the passage. Some sentences do not belong in the summary because the express ideas that are not presented in the passage or are minor ideas in the passage. This question is worth 2 points.

This passage discusses fundamental differences between applied-art objects and fine-objects.


**Answer Choices**

>>1. Applied-art objects fulfill functions, such as containing or sheltering, and objects with the same function have similar characteristics because they are constrained by their purpose.
2. It is easy to recognize that Shang Dynasty vases are different from Inca vase.x
3. Fine-art objects are not functional, so they are limited only by the properties of the materials used.
4. Renaissance sculptors learned to use iron braces to strengthen the internal structures of bronze statues.
5. In the twentieth century, fine artists and applied artists became more similar to one another in their attitudes toward their materials.x
6. In all periods, fine artists tend to challenge the physics limitations of their materials while applied artists tend to cooperate with the physical properties of their materails.x

####Type 10: Fill in a Table Questions-题型10：填表题

In this kind of question, you will be given a partially completed table based on information in the passage. Your job is to complete the table by clicking on correct answer choices and dragging them to their correct locations in the table.
Fill in a Table questions measure your ability to conceptualize and organize major ideas and other important information from across the passage and then to place them in appropriate categories. This means that you must first recognize and identify the major points from the passage, and then place those points in their proper context.
Just as for Prose Summary questions, the able reader will create a mental framework to organize and remember major ideas and other important information.
Doing so requires the ability to understand rhetorical functions such as cause-effect relationships, compare-contrast relationships, arguments, and the like.
When building your mental framework, keep in mind that the major ideas in the passage are the ones you would include if you were making a fairly high-level outline of the passage. The correct answer choices are usually ideas that would be included in a slightly more detailed outline. Minor details and examples are generally not included in such an outline because they are used only to support the more important, higher-level themes. The distinction between major ideas/important information and less important information can also be thought of as a distinction between essential and nonessential information.
Passage used with Fill in a Table questions have more than one focus of development in that they are include more than one point of view or perspective. Typical passages have the following types of organization: compare/contrast, problem/solution, cause/effect, alternative arguments(such as theories, hypotheses), and the like.
Correct answer represent major ideas and important supporting information in the passage. Generally these answer will not match specific phrases in the passage. They are more likely to be abstract concepts based on passage information or paraphrases of passage information. Correct answers will be easy to confirm by able readers who can remember or easily locate relevant text information.
Incorrect answer may include information about the topic that is not mentioned in the passage or that is not directly revelant to the classification categories in the table. They may also be obviously incorrect generalizations or conclusions based on what is stated in the passage. Be aware that incorrect answers may include words and phrases that match to resemble words of phrases in the passage.

在这类问题中，你会被给到一个基于文章信息的未完成的表格。你的工作是选择正确的选项并将其拖到表格中合适的位置。

填表题衡量你概念化认知文章主旨和重要信息的能力，然后要求你将它们进行合理的归类。这要求你首先要能识别文中的主要观点信息，然后将这些信息放到合适的背景框架中。

与文章总结类题目一样，填表题也要求你能够在脑中形成文章的框架并记住主旨与重要信息。

这么做需要你有能力理解诸如因果关系、对比关系、论证等修辞功能。（这里的理解存疑）

当你在构建心理框架时，记住主要观点是你那些你在进行高度概括时也需要包含进去的信息。正确的选项通常是那些稍微详细一点的概括信息。小的细节以及例子一般不会包含在其中，因为这些都只是用来支持更重要更高级别的主题的。主要信息/观点之间的差别也可以看做是必要信息与非必要信息之间的差别。

填空题对应的文章会对一个问题进行多个角度和方面的展开。典型的此类文章一般会用以下的组织方式：比较/对比，问题/解决方式，因果，不同论证（比如理论与假设），诸如此类。

正确答案包含了文章主旨以及重要的支持信息。通常情况下这些选项不会与文中具体的叙述一模一样，而更像是文章段落的摘要。对于有能力记住并轻易找出关联信息的读者来说回答正确将是简单的。

错误答案可能包含与文章话题无关的信息或与给出表格中信息分类不符的描述。它们也可能明显包含基于文章内容的错误归纳或结论。要注意错误选项可能包含与文中某些句子类似的表述。



***Table Rules***-列表使用规则

Table can have two or three columns/rows containing bullets representing five correct answer choices.
表格会有两或三列，其中有代表5个正确答案的小黑点。
There will always be more answer choices than there are correct answers. Some answer choices will not be used.
给出的选项数量将会比正确选项的数量更多。
An answer choice can be used only once in the table. If an answer choice applies to more than one answer category, or to no category in a table, a row or column labeled "both" or "neither" will be available in the table for placement of that answer choice.
一个选项只能被用于填入一个空栏。如果一个选项适用于多于一个分类，或者在表中没有分类。纵列中将会标记“both”或“neither”来适用于这个选项。（此处存疑）


***Scoring***-得分
To earn points, you must not only select correct answer choices, but also arganize them correctly in the table. You may receive partial credit, depending on how many correct answers you choose.
You can earn up to total of 3 points, depending on how many correct answers you select and correctly place. For zero, one, or two correct answers you will receive no points. For three corect answers you will receive 1 point; for four correct answers you will receive 2 points; and for all five answers you will receive the entire 3 points.
为了得分，你不仅仅要选出正确选项，还要将他们正确的填入表中。你可能会得到部分分数，这取决于你填对了几个。0-2个选项正确不得分，3个正确得1分，四个正确得2分，5个对得3分。



**Example**
Note: The passage used for this example is the same one that was used above for the Prose Summary example question. In an actual test, you will not receive both a Prose Sumamry question and a Fill a Table question about the same passage.
注意：这段文章与上面的文章总结类题目的文章是同一篇。在实际的考试中，一篇文章的题目中不会同时出现这两类题。

>**Directions:** Complete the table below to summarize information about the two types of art discussed in the passage. Match the appropriate statements to types of art with which they are associated. This question is worth 3 points.


>>|**TYPES OF ART**|**STATEMENTS**|
|---|---|
|The Applied arts|Select 3|
||● Objects serve a functional purpose.|
||● The basic form of objects varies little across cultures.|
||● Artists work in concert with their materials.|
|The Fine Arts|Select 2|
||● An object's purpose is primarily aesthetic.|
||● Artists work to overcome the limitations of their materials.|


>>**Statements**
1. An object's purpose is primarily aesthetic.
2. Objects serve a functional purpose.
3. The incidental details of objects do not vary.
4. Artists work to overcome the limitations of their materials.
5. The basic form of objects varies little across cultures.
6. Artists work in concert with their materials.

##2.3 Strategies for Preparing for the Reading Section-阅读部分准备策略

Now you are familiar with the 10 question types that are used in the TOEFL Reading Section, you are ready to sharpen your skills by working on whole reading sets. In the following pages, you can practice on six reading sets created by ETS for the TOEFL iBT test. The question types are not labeled, but you should be able to identify them and understand what you need to do to answer each correctly. After each passage and question set you will find answers and explanations for each question.
In addition to practicing on these sets, here are some other suggestions for improving the skills that will help you perform well on the Reading section:
The best way to improve reading skills is to read frequently and to read many different types of texts in various subject areas (science, socail science, arts, business, and others). The Internet is one of the best resources for this, and of course books, magazines, and journals are very helpful as well. Make sure to regularly read texts that are academic in style, the kind that are used in university courses.
Here are some suggestions for ways to build skills for the three reading purposes covered by the TOEFL iBT test.

现在你已经熟悉了阅读部分的10种题型，你已经准备好了磨炼你的阅读技能。在下面的页面中你可以通过ETS给出的6篇阅读题来练习。题目的类型不会标注出来，但是你应该有能力识别并知道如何正确回答。题目后面会有相应的答案和解释。
作为练习的补充，这里给出了一些提高你在阅读部分表现的建议：


1. Reading to find information-通过阅读找到信息
* Scan passages to find and highlight key facts(dates, numbers, terms) and information.
扫视全文找到高亮标注的内容。
* Practice this frequently to increase reading rate and fluency.
经常练习这个技能来增加熟练度。


2. Reading for basic comprehension-通过阅读进行基本的理解
* Increase your vocabulary knowledge, perhaps by using flashcards.
增加你的词汇知识储备。
* Rather than carefully reading each word and each sentence, practice skimming a passage quickly to get a general impression of the main idea.
比起逐词逐句阅读，你也可以尝试通过快速浏览来抓住文章大意。
* Build up your ability to skim quickly and to identify the major points.
构建你快速浏览并识别文章主旨的能力。
* After skimming a passage, read it again more carefully and write down the main idea, major points, and important facts.
在浏览全文后，仔细阅读文章并记录下文章主旨，主要观点和重要信息。
* Choose some unfamilar words in a passage and guess the meaning from the context(surrounding sentences).
寻找一些生词，结合上下文语境猜它的含义。
* Select all the pronouns(*he， him, they, and others*) and identify which nouns they refer to in a passage.
弄清楚所有的代词指代的是什么。
* Practice making inferences an drawing conclusions based on what is implied in the passage as a whole.
练习推断文章中的隐含结论。

3. Reading to learn-通过阅读认知

* Identify the passage type (classification, cause/effect, compare/contrast, problem/solution, description, narration, and so on).
识别文章类型（分类说明，因果关系，比较对比关系，问题与解决方法，说明文，叙述文，等等）
* Do the following to organize the information in the passage:
* Create an outline of the passage to distinguish between major and minor points.
   * If the passage categorizes information, create a chart and place the information in appropriate categories.(Remember: on the test, you do not have to create such a chart. Instead, a chart with possible answer choices is provided for you , and you must fill in the chart with the correct choices.) Practicing this skill will help you think about categorizing information and be able to do so with ease.
   * If the passage describes the steps in a process, create an outline of the steps in their correct order.
   * Create a summary of the passage using the charts and outlines.
做以下这些来组织文章信息：
构建一个关于文章主要观点与次要观点的框架。
如果文章将信息分了类，创建一个图表将不同信息归入不同的类别中。（记住，在考试中，你不需要每次都建立这样一个图表。相反的是你将会被给到一个图表让你来选入相关信息）练习这项技能能让你更加轻松的将信息进行归类。
如果文章描述了实现某个过程的步骤，以正确的步骤创建一个大的框架。
用图表或者框架总结文章

   * Paraphrase individual sentences in a passage, and then progress to paraphrasing an entire paragraph. Note: the TOEFL iBT Reading section measures the ability to recognize paraphrases. The ability to paraphrase is also important for the integrated tasks in the Writing and Speaking sections of the test.
复述文中的单独句子，然后慢慢发展到复述整篇文章。注意：托福考试的阅读部分只考察你的认知理解能力。复述能力对于写作和口语中的综合部分也是十分重要的。

#3 Listening Section-听力部分

（此部分没有记录听力的例题，为节约时间，这部分例题的熟悉留到后面实际接触的时候）

>**Read this chapter to learn**
>>* The 8 types of TOEFL iBT Listening questions-听力部分的8种题型
* How to recognize each Listening question type-如何识别不同听力题型
* Tips for answering each Listening question type-应对每种题型的建议
* Strategies for preparing for the Listening section-听力部分的准备策略


**In the TOEFL iBT Listening section you will listen to four to six lectures and two to three conversations. These will be six questions per lecture and five questions per conversation. You will have a total of 60 to 90 minutes to answer all of the Listening questions.**

在托福听力考试中你将会听到4-6个讲座和2-3段对话。每段讲座有6道题，每段对话有5道题。你总共有60-90分钟时间来完成这些问题。（每段对话或讲座总时间10分钟）

##3.1 Listening Materials-听力材料

There are two types of Listening materials on the TOEFL iBT test, conversations and lectures. Both are based on the actual speech that is used in North American colleges and universities.
Each lecture or conversation is 3-6 minutes long and, as far as possible, represents authentic academic language. For example, a professor giving a lecture may digress somewhat from the main topic, interactions between students and the professor can be extensive, and explainations of content can be elaborate. Features of oral language such as false starts, misspeaks with self-corrections, and repetitions are included. The speakers who record the text are encouraged to use their own speech patterns(for example, with pauses and hesitations), as long as they preserve the content of the text. You should take notes during the lectures and conversations. This material is not meant to test your memory.
托福考试中有两种听力材料，讲座和对话。他们都基于北美大学中会用到的真实对话。每段讲座或对话3-6分钟长，且都尽可能的代表了真实的学术对话语言。例如教授在讲座时将话题稍稍带离主要话题，学生和教授之间可能会频繁对话，对目录内容进行详尽的解释。诸如错误的开头，口误后的自我纠正，还有复述这类口头语言都会被包含进去。录制听力材料的人被鼓励使用它们自己的语言风格，比如偶尔的停顿与犹豫，只要他们保存了原文本的内容。听材料的时候你最好做笔记，这些材料不是用来考察你的记忆力的。

###3.1.1 Conversations
**There are two types of conversations in the Listening section:**
>* office hours
* service encounters

These conversations are typical of those that occur on North American university campuses. Office hours conversations are interactions that take place in a professor's office. The content may be academic or related to course requirements. For example, in an office conversation a student could request an extension on a due date (nonacademic content), or a student could ask for clarification about the content of a lecture (academic content). Service encounters are interactions that take place on a university campus and have nonacademci content. Examples include inquiring about a payment for housing and registerting for class. Each conversation is followed by five questions.
这些对话都是在北美大学校园中发生的典型情景。办公场所的对话是在教授办公室发生的对话配合，对话内容可以是学术的或者关于课程要求的。比如，一个学生要求延长截止日期，或者一个学生请教关于讲座内容的问题。服务情景对话是发生在大学校园中的非学术性对话，比如询问房租的支付问题或者课程注册问题。每段对话后面有5个问题。

###3.1.2 Lectures
Lectures in Listening section represent the kind of language used when professors teach in a classroom. The lecture excerpt may include just a professor speaking, a student asking the proffessor a question, or the proffessor asking the students a question and calling on one student for a response. Each lecture is approximately 5 miniutes in length and is followed by 6 questions.
The content of the lectures reflects the content that is presented in introductory-level academic settings. Lecture topics cover a broad range of subjects. You will not be expected to have any prior knowledge of the subject matter. All the information you need to answer the questions will be contained in the lecture. The lists below are provided to give you an idea of the topics that typically appear in the Listening section. In general these topics are divided into four major categories:
讲座段落使用的是教授在教室中发生的讲话内容。讲座节选内容可能是教授讲完整个讲座，或者一个学生向教授提问，或者教授提出问题并让一个学生来回答。对一段讲座时长大约5分钟，对应6个问题。
讲座的内容代表的是入门级学术环境中谈话内容。讲座话题涵盖广泛的学科内容。这不会要求你拥有相关的知识背景。回答问题所需要的所有信息都包含在讲座内容中。下面的清单包含了典型的话题类别。这些话题被分为四个大类：

>* Arts-艺术

##3.2 Listening Questions-听力题类型

Most of the listening questions that follow the lectures and conversations are traditional multiple-choice questions with four answer choices and a single correct answer. There are, however, some other types of questions:
绝大多数讲座或对话后的听力听都是传统的单选或多选题，以下是一些题目的类型：


* multiple-choice questions with more than one correct answer(for example, two answers out of four choices or three answers out of five choices)
多选题。四选二或者五选三。
* questions that require you to put in order events or steps in a process
要求你填写事件步骤的题。
* questions that require you to match objects or text to categories in a table
信息匹配分类题。

Some questions replay a part of the lecture or conversation. You will then be asked a multiple-choice question about what you have just heard.
There are eight types of questions in the Listening section. These types are divided into three categories as follows:
有些题目会让你重听录音的某一段。然后你将会回答一个相关的多选题。总共有8中类型的题目，这些题目又被归为三个大类。

下面的部分将分别介绍每一种题型。解释如何识别每一种题型。最后会给予你一些答题的建议。

###Basic Comprhension Questions

Basic comprehension of the lecture or conversation is tested in three ways: with Gist-content, Gist-purpose, and Detail questions.
基本理解类题目用三种题型来考察：内容主旨，主旨目的和细节问题。

####Type 1: Gist-content Questions
Understanding the gist of a lecture of conversation means understanding the general topic or main idea. The gist of the lecture of conversation may be expressed explicitly or implicitly. Questions that test understanding the gist of a lecture of conversation may require you to generalize or synthesize information from what you hear.
理解讲座或对话的主旨意味着理解一般性话题与主要观点。主旨可能被清楚地表述或者表述的不那么明确，所以要求你概括或者综合你所听到的信息。

>***How to Recognize Gist-content Questions***-如何识别主旨内容题
Gist-content questions are typically phrased as follows:

>>* What problem dose the man have?
这个人遇到了什么问题？
* What are the speakers mainly discussing?
他们讨论的主要内容是什么？
* What is the main topic of the lecture?
这个讲座的主要话题是什么？
* What is the lecture mainly about?
这个讲座主要是关于什么的？
* What aspect of X does the professor mainly discuss?
教授在讨论关于X的那个方面？

>***Tips fo Gist-content Questions***- 主旨内容题的建议

>>* Gist-content questions ask about the overall content of the lecture or conversation. Eliminate choices that refer to only small portions of what you just listened to.
主旨内容题谈论的是整体上的内容，排除那些只涉及小部分内容的选项。
* Use your notes. Decide what overall theme ties details in your notes together. Choose the answer that comes closest to describing this overall theme.
用好你的笔记。决定你笔记中的那些细节是能够与主旨联系在一起的。选择与整体主旨描述最接近的选项。

####Type 2: Gist-purpose Questions-题型2：主旨目的题
Some gist questions focus on the purpose of the conversation or lecture rather than on the content. This type of question will more likely occur with conversations, but Gist-purpose questions may also occasionally be asked about lectures.
这类题目的关注点更侧重谈话或者讲座目的而不是具体内容，这种情况更多的是在对话中出现，不过也偶尔会在讲座题目中出现。

>***How to recognize Gist-purpose Questions***-如何识别主旨目的题
Gist-purpose questions are typically phrased as follows:

>>* Why dose the student visit the professor?
学生为什么去找教授？
* Why does the sutdent visit the register's office?
学生为什么去注册办公室？
* Why did the professor ask to see the student?
教授为什么召唤学生？
* Why does the professor explian X?
教授为什么要解释X？

>***Tips for Gist-purpose Questions***-主旨目的题建议

>>* Students visit professors during office hours for various reasons, inlcuding cases in which a professor invites a student in to discuss the student's performance on an assingnment. To answer a Gist-purpose question, look in your notes for information that identifies the reason that the student visited the professor in the first place.
学生在上班时间拜访教授有多种原因，包括教授与学生讨论他在工作任务中的表现。回答这类问题要审视你的笔记，找到学生拜访教授的**第一原因**。
* The purpose of a conversation is not always related to the conversation's main topic. For example, a student might visit her professor for the purpose of asking a question about the professor's grading policy. After answering her question, the professor might spontaneously ask how the student is progressing on a research project, and the rest of the conversation is about that project.
谈话的目的（第一目的）有时候并不是与谈话的主要话题相关。比如一个学生拜访教授是为了询问教授的评分政策。问完这个问题后，教授有顺便问起学生的项目进展情况，后面的话题也全是与这个项目相关的。
* In service encounter conversations, the student is often trying to solve a problem. Understanding what the student's problem is and how it will be solved will help you answer the Gist-pupose questions.
在遇到服务类问题时，学生通常是在试图去解决一个问题。理解学生的问题到底是什么以及他将会怎么解决会对你的解题很有帮助。


####Type 3: Detail Questions-题型3：细节题

Detail questions require you to understand and remember explicit details or fact from a lecture or conversation. These details are typically related, directly or indirectly, to the gist of the conversation or lecture, by provding elaboration, examples, or other support. In some cases where there is a long digression that is not clearly related to the main idea, you may be asked about some details of the digression.
细节题需要你记住并理解讲座和对话中的详细细节或具体事实。这些细节通常有直接或间接的关联，通常都是为主旨提供详尽的案例与其他事实支撑。在有些录音中可能会有部分话题延展或跑题的内容并不与文章主旨相关。

>***How to recognize Detail Questions***-如何识别细节题
Detail questions are typically phrased as follows:

>>* According to the professor, what is one way that X can affect Y?
根据教授的话语，X可以影响Y的一种方式是？
* What is X?
X是什么？
* What resulted from the invention of the X?
X的发明带来了怎样的结果？
* According to the professor, what is the main problem with the X theory?
根据教授的描述，X理论的主要问题是什么？

>***Tips for Detail Questions***-细节题建议

>>* Refer to your notes as you answer. You will not be asked about minor points. Your notes should contain the major details from the conversation or lecture.
回答时参考你的笔记，你将不会被问到次要观点。你的笔记应该包含关于讲座或谈话的主要细节。
* Do not choose an answer only because it contains some of the words that were used in the conversation or lecture. Incorrect responses willo often contain words and phrases from the lecture or conversation.
不要因为一个选项中有些描述与录音中的内容一样就选择他，很多错误答案就有这样的特征。
* If you are unsure of the correct response, decide which one of the choice is most consistent with the main idea of the conversation of lecture.
如果你不能确定正确答案，那就选择与文章主旨最为一致的那个选项。


###Pragmatic Understanding Questions-语用理解类题目

Pragmatic Understanding questions test understanding of certain features of spoken English that go beyond basic comprehension. In general, these types of questions test how well you understand the ***function*** of an utterance or the stance, or attitude, that the speaker expresses. In most instances, Pragmatic Understanding questions will test parts of the conversation or lecture where a speaker's purpose or attitude is not expressed directly. In these cases, what is directly stated--the surface expression--will not be an exact match of the statement's function or purpose.
语用理解类题目考察一些比基础理解更高级的口语特征的理解。一般来说这类题目测试你对不同说话方式的功能的理解，比如其中蕴含的态度和立场等。大多数这类题都会考察对话或讲座中说话者没有直接表达意图的部分，说话者字面上的意思将不会和他所想表达的真正意图一致。

What people say is often intended to be understood on a level that lies beyond or beneath the surface expression. To use an often-cited example, the sentence "It sure is cold in here" can be understood literally as a statement of fact about the tempertature of a room. But suppose the speaker is , say, a guest in you home ,who is also shivering and glancing at an open window. In that case, what your guest may really mean is that he wants you to close the open window. In this example ,the function of the speaker's statement --getting you to close the window--lies beneath the surface expression. Functions that often lie beneath the suface expression include directing, recommending, complaining, accepting, agreeing, narrating, questioning, and others.
人们说话时常常将真正的意思藏在话语之下，使用一个经常被引用的例子，“明显这里很冷”这个句子可以从字面上理解为在表述一个屋子里的温度。但如果假设这是一个在你家窗边的客人说的，那么客人的真正意思是想让你关上打开的窗户。在这个例子中，说话者真的的意图——想要关上窗子——就埋藏在他的话语之下。隐含在字面表达下的话语意图通常有指导，建议，抱怨，接受，同意，叙述，质疑，以及其他。

Understanding meaning within the context of an entire lecture or conversation is critical in instance where the speaker's stance is involved. Is a given statement intended to be taken as fact or opinion? How certain is the speaker of the infomation she is reporting? Is the speaker's conveying certain feelings of attitudes about some person or thing or event? As above, these feelings or attitudes may lie beneath the surface expression. Thus they can easilly go unrecognized or be misunderstood by nonnative speakers.
在一个完整对话或讲座的语境下来理解说话者的意图是很重要的，比如说话者的立场。一个给定的陈述，旨在表达观点还是事实？讲话者对他所说的内容有多大程度的肯定？讲话者是在传达他对某些人或者物的态度吗？总而言之，这些感受和态度可能藏在字面意思之下。如此便会很容易的误导或者迷惑非英语母语使用者。

Some Pragmatic Understanding questions involve a replay of part of the lecture of conversation in order to focus your attention on the revelant portion. There are two types of Pragmatic Understanding questions: Understanding the Function of What is Said questions and Understanding the Speaker's Attitude questions.
有些语用理解类题目会让你重听对话或讲座某一部分，以此让你将注意力集中到相关部分。语用理解类问题分为两种：话语目的理解和理解态度立场问题


####Type 4: Understanding the Function of What Is Said Questions-题型4： 话语目的类题目
The first tyle of Pragmatic Understanding question tests whether you can understand the function of what is said. This question type often involve listening again to a portion of the lecture or conversation.
这类题目考察你是否能理解说话者的话语目的，这种题目常会让你做题前重听对话或讲座的某一部分。

>***How to recognize Understanding the Function of What is Said Questions***-如何识别话语目的类题目
>>Understanding the Function of What is Said questions are typically phrased as follows:

>>* What dose the professor imply when he says this ?(replay)-教授话语中的隐含意思是什么？
* Why dose the student say this ? (replay)-学生为什么要这么说？
* What dose the professor mean when she says this ?(replay)-当教授这么说的时候意味着什么？

>***Tips for Understanding the Function of What is Said Questions***-话语目的类题目建议

>>Remember that the function of what is said may not match what the speaker directly states. I
n the following example, an administrative assistant asks a student if he knows where the housing office is. She is not, however, doing this to get information about the housing office's location.
记住说话者说话的真正目的可能与字面意思不一致。在下面的例子中，一个行政助手问学生知不知道住房办公室在哪里？实际上他这么做并不是真的想知道住房办公室的位置。


####Type 5: Understanding the Speaker's Attitude Questions

The second type of Pragmatic Undertanding question tests whether you undertand a speaker's attitude or opinion. You may be asked a questions about the speaker's feelings, likes and dislikes, or reason of anxiety or amusement. Also include in this catogory are questions about a speaker's degree of certainly: Is the speaker referencing a source or given a personal opinion? Are the facts presented generally accepted or are they disputed? Occasionally, a question will test your ability to detect and understand irony. A speaker is being ironic when the intented meaning is the opposite of what he or she is actually saying. For example, the utterance "That's great" can be delivered with an intonation that gives the utterance the meaning "That's not good at all" . Speakers use irony for a variety of purpose, including emphasizing a point being made, bringing humor to a situation in order to win audience sympathy, or expressing disapproval in an indirect way. Listeners must infer the ironic statement's real meaning both from clues provided in the context and from the speaker's intonation.
语用理解类题目第二种题目是考察你是否理解说话者的态度和立场。你可能会被问到一个关于说话者的感受的问题，比如喜欢或者不喜欢，焦虑或者愉快的原因。也包括一类关于说话者肯定程度的问题：说话者是在引用还是在表达个人观点？某些事实是被广泛接受还是有争议的？偶尔也会有题目考察你对讽刺意味的理解。当一个说话者所陈述的字面意思和他要表达的真实意思相反时他就是在使用讽刺。比如“That's great”这个表达可以表达这一点也不好的意思。使用讽刺手法可以有很多目的，比如强调某个重点，给讲话注入一些幽默气息以获得观众支持，或者用间接的方式表达自己的反对观点。听者必须同时从讲话者的语境线索和他的语气语调中推测讽刺的真实含义。

>***How to Recognize Understanding the Speaker's Attitude Questions***-如何识别观点立场类题目
Understanding the Speaker's attitude questions are typically phrased as follows:

>>* What can be inferred about the student ?-关于学生能推测出什么？
* What is the professor's attitude toward X ?-教授的意图是什么?
* What is the professor's opinion of X ?-教授对X的态度是什么？
* What can be inferred about the student when she says this ?(replay)-学生所说的话中能推测出什么？
* What dose the woman mean when she says this ?(replay)-这位女士这么说的意思是？

>***Tips for Understanding the Speaker's Attitude Questions***-观点立场类题目建议

>>Learn to pay attention to the speaker's tone of voice. Does the speaker sound apologetic? Confused? Enthusiastic? The speaker's tone can help you answer this kind of quesiton.
学习注意说话者的语气音调。他的声音听起来充满歉意？困惑？热情？

###Connecting Information Questions-信息联系类问题

Connecting Information questions require you to make connections between or among pieces of information in the lecture or conversation. Your ability to intergrate information from different parts of the lecture o conversation, to make inferences, to draw conclusions, to form generalizations, and to make predictions is tested. To choose the right answer,  you will need to be able to identify and explian relationships among ideas and details in a lecture or conversation. These relationships may be explicit or implicit.
There are three types of Connecting Information questions.
信息联系题要求你将对话或讲座中的多个信息碎片联系起来。这将会考察你从讲座或对话的不同部分综合信息的能力，推理能力，概括能力，归纳能力，预测能力。想要回答正确你需要有能力识别和解释材料中各个观点和细节之间的关系。这些关系可能是直观的或不直观的。这类题目有两种题型。

####Type 6: Understanding Organization Questions-题型6：组织构架理解类题目
In Understanding Organization questions you may be asked about the overall organization of the lecture, or you may be asked about the relationship between two portions of what you heard. Here are two examples:
这类题目中你会被问到讲座的整体组织构架，或者你会被问到两个部分之间的关系，这里有两个例子：

>* How does the professor oganize the information that she presents to the class?
教授在课上是怎样组织信息并将其传达给学生的？

>In the order in which the events occurred 按事件发生顺序

>* How does the professor clarify the points he makes about Mexico?
教授是怎样就他对墨西哥的观点进行分类的？

>By comparing Mexico to a neighboring country
通过把墨西哥同其邻国进行比较。


The first of these questions asks about the overall organization of information, testing understanding of connections throughout the whole lecture. The second asks about a portion of the lecture, testing understanding of the relationship between two different ideas.
Some Understanding Organization questions may ask you to identify or recognize how one statement functions with respect to surrounding statements. Functions may include indicating or signaling a topic shift, connecting a main topic to a subtopic,providing an introduction or a conclusion, giving an example, starting a digression, or even making a joke.
第一类题目问你信息的整体框架，考察你对整个讲座的通篇理解。第二个问题问的是关于讲座中某一部分的问题，考察你对于两个不同观点之间的关系的理解。有些组织构架理解类题目可能会问一个陈述对其周围的语句陈述造成了什么影响或有什么功能。可能会是话题转折的一个提示点，主要话题和次要话题的连接，提供说明或结论，比如说开始一个题外话或者开一个玩笑。


>***How to recognize Understanding Organization Questions***-如何识别组织构架理解类题目
Understanding Organization questions are typically phrased as follows:

>>* How does the professor organize the information about X ?-教授是怎样组织关于X的信息的？
* How is the discussion organized?-这个讨论是怎样组织的？
* Why does the professor discuss X?-教授为什么要讨论X？
* Why does the professor mention X ?-教授为什么提到X？

>***Tips for Understanding Organization Questions***-组织构架理解类题目建议

>>* Questions that ask about overall organization are more likely to be found after lectures than after conversations. Refer to your notes to answer the questions. It may not have been apparent from the start that the professor organized the information (for example) chronologically, or from least to most complex, or in some other way.
* Pay attention to comparisons made by the professor. In the following example the professor is discussing the structure of plants. He uses steel and steel girders in a new building to make a point. When the professor mentions something that is seemingly off-topic, you should ask yourself what point the professor is making.
这类题目一般都出现在讲座类题目中。检视你的笔记并回答这些问题。一开始时信息组织的方式或许不明显，比如时间顺序，或者从简单到复杂，或者其他方式。
注意教授所做的比较。在下面的例子中教授在讨论植物的构成方式。他使用钢铁和钢梁来进行讲解。当教授提到一些看起来无关的话题时，你应该问自己教授到底在说什么？



####Type 7: Connecting Content Questions-题型7：内容连接题
Connecting Content questions measure your understanding of the relationships among ideas in a lecture. These relationships may be explicitly stated, or you may have to infer them from the words you hear.
The questions may ask you to orgainize information in a different way from the way it was presented in the lecture. You might be asked to identify comparisions, cause and effect, or contradiction and agreement. You may also be asked to classify items in categories, indentify a sequence of events of steps in a process, or specify relationships among objects along some dimension.
内容连接题考察你对讲座中不同观点之间的联系的理解。这些关系可能会被明确的表述出来，也有可能需要你通过对你听到的进行推理。
题目可能会让你用和录音中不同的方式对信息进行重新组织。你可能会被要求识别比较关系，因果关系，或者矛盾和一致关系。你也可能会被要求将条目进行分类，判读事件顺序，或者用某种方式列举事物之间的关系。

**Example**

![QQ截图20161024150043.jpg-89.4kB][22]

>***How to Recognize Connecting Content Questions***-如何识别内容联系类题目
Connecting Content questions are typically phrazed as follows:

>* What is the likely outcome of doing procedure X before procedure Y ?-在步骤Y之前进行步骤X最可能的结果是？
* What can be inferred about X ? 关于X能推断出什么？
* What does the professor imply about X ?-教授暗示了关于X的什么内容？

>***Tips for Connecting Content Questions***-内容联系类题目建议
Questions that require you to fill in a chart or table or put events in order fall into this category. As you listen to the lectures accompanying this study guide, pay attention to the way you format your notes. Clearly identifying terms and their definitions as well as steps in a process will help you answer questions of this type.
这些问题要求你填表或者将事件依顺序填入对应分类。当你在听讲座和题目导语时，注意你做笔记的方式。将笔记条目进行清晰地分类或者按照一定的顺序进行排列将有助于你回答这类问题。

####Type 8: Making Inferences Questions-题型8：推断题
The final type of Connecting Information question is Making Inferences questions. In this kind of question you usually have to reach a conclusion based on facts presented in the lecture or conversation.
最后一种信息联系题时推断题。这是一类让你根据讲座或者对话中的事实陈述推断出结论的问题。

>***How to Recognize Making Inferences Questions***-如何识别推断题
Making Inferences questions are typically phrased as follows:

>>* What does the professor imply about X ?-教授传达了关于X的什么隐含信息？
* What will the student probaly do next ?-学生下一步最可能做什么？
* What can be inferred about X ?-关于X能推断出什么？
* What does the professor imply when he says this?(replay)-教授这么说的隐含意思是什么？

>***Tip for Making Inferences Questions***-推断题建议
>>In some cases, answering this kind of question correctly means adding up details from the lecture or conversation to reach a conclusion. In other cases, the professor may imply something without directly stating it. In most cases the answer you choose will use vocabulary not found in the lecture or conversation.
在某些情况下，正确回答这类问题要求从讲座或对话中提取细节并得出结论。在另一些情况下，教授可能会暗示一些东西。大多数情况下正确的选项不会包含原文中含有的词语。

###**How to Sharpen Your Listening Skills**-如何打磨你的听力技能

Listening is one of the most important skills necessary for success on the TOEFL test and in academics in general. The ability to listen and understand is tested in three out of four sections of the TOEFL iBT test.
The best way to improve your listening skills is to listen frequently to many different types of material in various subject areas(sciences, social sciences, arts, business, and others). Of course, watching movies and TV and listening to the radio are excellent ways to practice listening. Audiotapes and CDs of talks are available in libraries and bookstores; those with transcripts of the listening material are particularly helpful. The Internet is also a great resource of listening material.
Here are some says you can stengthen skills for the three listening purposes tested on the TOEFL iBT test.

听力确保成功通过托福和一般学术考试的最重要技能之一。托福考试中4个部分中的三个部分都涉及到听力能力的考察。
提高听力能力的最好方式就是频繁的听不同学科不同主题的英文材料。

####**1.Listening for basic comprehension**-基本听力能力

* Increasing your vacabulary knowledge, perhaps by using flash cards.
增加词汇知识，比如使用卡片。

* Focus on the content and flow of material. Do not be destracted by the speaker's style and delivery.

* Anticipate what the speaker is going to say as a way to stay focused, and adjust your predictions when you recieve additional information.
预测讲话者接下来将会讲什么是一个很好的保持专注的方式，并且在听到相关消息后调整自己的预测。

* Stay active by asking yourself questions (for example, What main idea is the professor communicating?).
通过不断向自己提问来保持状态，比如教授交流的主要观点是什么？

**将“主旨，主要观点，重要细节”这些词提前写在纸上**，仔细听的时候做下笔录。在没有记录完所有重要观点和细节时再听一次。

* Listen to a portion of a lecture or talk and write a brief summary of important points. Gradually increas the amount you listen to and summarize. Note: summarizing skills are not tested in the Listening section, but they are useful for the integrated tasks in the Writing section and Speaking sections.
听讲座的其中一部分并对其进行总结。逐渐的增加段落的长度。注意：总结能力在听力部分不被测试，但在写作和口语部分会被测试。

####**2.Listening for pragmatic understanding**-语用理解听力

* Think about what each speaker hopes to accomplish; that is, what is the purpose of the speech or conversation? Is the speaker apologizing, complaining, making suggestions?
思考每个说话者想要完成什么，其实就是他说话的目的是什么？ 他是在道歉、抱怨、还是提建议？

#4 Speaking Section

>**Reading this chapter to learn-阅读这部分以学习：**
>>* The format of the 6 TOEFL iBT Speaking questions-托福口语考试的六种题型
* How your spoken responses are evaluated-你的回答是怎样被评判的
* Tips for answering each Speaking question type-每一种题型的建议
* Strategiss for preparing for the Speaking section-口语考试部分的准备策略

The TOEFL iBT Speaking section is designed to evaluate the English speaking proficiency of students whose native language is not English but who want to pursue undergraduate or graduate study in an English-speaking context. Like all the other sections of the TOEFL iBT test, the Speaking section is delivered via the Internet.
In the speaking section you will be asked to speak on a variety of topics that draw on personal experience, campus-based situations, and academic-type content material. There are six questions. The first two questions are called Independent Speaking tasks because they require you to draw entirely on your own ideas, opinions, adn experiences when responding. The other four questions are Integrated Speaking tasks. In these tasks you will listen to a conversation or to an excerpt from a lecture, or read a passage and then listen to a brief discussion or lecture excerpt, before you are asked the question. These questions are called Integrated tasks because they require that you integrate your English-language skills--listening and speaking, or reading, listening, and speaking. In responding to these questions, you will be asked to base your spoken response on the information in the discussion or lecture, or on both the discussion or lecture and the reading passage together.

>***Tip***
>>For each question, you are given 45 or 60 seconds to respond. So when practicing, time your speech according

The Speaking section takes approximately 20 minutes. Response time allowed for each question is 45 or. For Speaking questions that involve listening, you will hear short lectures or conversations on headphones. For Speaking questions that involve reading, you will read short written passages on your computer screen. You can take notes throughout the Speaking section and use your notes when responding to the Speaking questions. For each of the six questions, you will be given a short time to prepare a response. You will answer each of the questions by speaking into a microphone. Your responses will be recorded and sent to a scoring center, and they will be scored by experienced raters.

>***Tip***
>>Familiarize yourself with the scoring rubric. It will help you understand how responses are evaluated.

Your responses will be scored holistically.This means that the rater will listen for various features in your response and assign a single score based on the overall skill you display in you answer. Although scoring criteria vary somewhat depending on the question, the raters will generally be listening for the following features in your answer:

* **Delivery:**  How clear your speech is.Good responses are those in which the speech is fluid and clear, with good pronounciation, natural pacing, and natural-sounding intonation patterns.
* **Language Use:** How effectively you use grammar and vocabulary to convey your ideas. Raters will be listening for how well you can control both basic and more complex language structures and use appropriate vocabulary.
* **Topic Development:** How fully you answer the question and how coherently you presnet your ideas. Good responses generally use all or most of the time allotted, and the relationship between ideas and the progression form one idea to the next is clear and easy to follow.

It is important to note that raters do not expect your responses to be perfect, and high-scoring responses may contain occasional errors and minor lapeses in any of the three areas described above.
Use the sample Independent and Integrated Speaking rubrics on pages 188 to 191 to see how responses are scored.
