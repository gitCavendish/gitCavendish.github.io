> First picture. Play this one open stance

> Second your left side needs to be more open towards net before poc . at this stance only arm and wrist action. No shoulder anymore

- video would be better if it shows the contact point, and should be more closer.

**Forehand**

- You play with a lot of close stance in your forehands. You have your left foot going too much to your right side, so you are not allowing the hips to go fully during the forehand stroke. The left leg blocks your right hip.

- Also when you made mistakes, your left shoulder was too much turned to the right side while the racket touching the ball(this blocks the body too). The left shoulder should open up before contacting the ball.

- Next is learn to use a little bit more wrist snap on your forehand. Your wrist is tight. Before you hit the ball, wrist should be bent backwards, then when you hit the ball, your wrist should have a long action in the contact point, then you follow through.

- Most time you play with close stance, sometimes close stance is good but when you don't have enough time, you need more open and semi-open stance. If you only play close stance everything is a little bit too late.

**Backhand**

- Backhand looks good. But sometimes you over-rotate to the left, and you feel that, then you over-rotate back to the right side. You could open right leg a bit, and let more hip strenth pass to the ball.

Hi Dave,

First I want to say **thank you** for spending time to check the video and leave me all these thorough feedback.

I summarised your feedback as below:

---------------------------

**Forehand**

1. Too much close stance. My left foot steps too much to the right side. This blocks my right hip to generate strength and pass it to the ball. So I should try more open and semi-open stance to free my body.

2. When making mistakes, left shoulder was turned too much to the right either, this also blocks my body(shoulder), at this posture only arm and wrist move. The left shoulder should open up before contacting the ball.

3. Wrist is tight, before hitting the ball, wrist should be naturally bent backwards, then has a long trajectory(action) move towards the ball, then follow through.

**Backhand**

1. Sometimes I over rotate to the left, then I over rotate to the right. I should open right leg a bit, and let more hip strenth pass to the ball.

2. Upper body should be more stable.

Did I miss anything that you told me?
