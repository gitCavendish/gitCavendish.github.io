This would be like blaming an aspiring doctor for spending years studying medicine before beginning to practice.

Studying on your own will be hard and there will be times you want to quit or cash in early for a crappy job. If that person isn't 100% committed to learning to program then they will be strongly tempted to stop to do something easier.

1) Were you married or in a serious relationship while going through Launch School? If so, do you have any specific advice on balancing the two?

Yes, I had just gotten engaged when I began Launch School and got married part way through studying. My biggest advice for people in a serious relationship is to get your significant other on board with your goals. That should be your main focus before you even begin Launch School. If you and your SO aren't on the same page before you begin studying, it's going to make it very difficult to balance them both.

That was one of my biggest mistakes when I first started doing Launch School. My wife was rather skeptical of me studying full time instead of going out to look for a job. I had changed careers multiple times in the period that we were dating and she knew I was rather flighty in my aspirations.

She knew I wanted to learn web development, but she wasn't convinced that doing Launch School was the best choice. She was worried that I would change my mind part way through (can't blame her for that) or that it was just going to take too long. She felt that if I was really committed to learning web development, I should do a bootcamp so that I could get a job faster. She made enough money to support us both while I studied, but she didn't want to be the sole bread-winner for multiple years. However, I thought bootcamps were too expensive and didn't want to add any more debt than what I already had, so I started doing Launch School anyway without fully convincing her it was the best choice.

That wasn't a good idea, to say the least.

Whenever she heard about a bootcamp grad getting a decent job in only a couple months, she would bring up doing bootcamps again and I would somewhat lie to her saying "it'll only be a couple more months, I'm almost done" even though I knew it wasn't true. And once those couple months would pass, she would become anxious again since I didn't seem much closer to finishing.

Luckily, with time, I was able to win her over. Any remaining doubts she had were completely erased when I began my job hunt and she saw the types of companies that wanted to interview me and the offers I was getting. However, that initial friction was 100% my fault and could've been avoided had I only spent time with her, in the beginning, to thoroughly explain why I believed Launch School was the best choice.

To make a very long story short, if you're in a serious relationship, your first job before you begin studying Launch School is to make your significant other your champion supporter. It will make studying, especially when times become difficult or lonely, so much easier with them by your side and cheering you on.

The worst piece of advice I ever read about while I was learning was pretty much the opposite of the best advice. I read a blog post one time from a guy who was telling people to pretty much start looking for a job as soon as you get any skill whatsoever. He essentially said that it may take you 6 months to find a job, but on-the-job learning is the only way you really become an engineer. It was complete BS.

So many people want to become engineers and get well-paying jobs but don't want to put the effort in. They want some sort of shortcut. I actually know someone who started Launch School roughly around the same time I did and we progressed around the same pace. However, that person decided to leave in order to do a bootcamp that promised faster results. I keep going and eventually enrolled into Capstone.

When I got my job at DigitalOcean, this person reached out to me asking for advice. They had been searching for a job for a while and were struggling a lot. I empathized them because I understand how hard it is to get rejected during the job search. On the other hand, my first thought when they asked for advice was, "you should've stayed at Launch School".

The slow path to mastery is, in the long run, the fastest route to success.

Moving to New York City was definitely a big change. I moved from Seattle, which is also a decently sized city, but nothing like New York. I definitely had to get used to sheer number of people and that fact that there are always people on the street no matter the time of night. It's also much faster paced than any other city I've ever lived in.

However, the amount of opportunity here is crazy. Companies are hungry for great talent. Excellent engineers can get interviews in a matter of hours or days when they start looking. I've seen it happen. Heck, my wife is looking for a new product design job and she's already gotten close to 10 referrals in a matter of days thanks to connections and friends she's made in the industry. It's hard to find those types of connections and opportunities in other cities, except for maybe San Francisco.

For those of you who can't do Capstone or don't want to, Launch School is still 100% worth completing. However, you will need to do your own type of Capstone program once you finish the Core Curriculum. Building a non-trivial project will help separate yourself from candidates who have Reddit or Twitter clones in their portfolio. Employers also like seeing candidates with production quality projects since it tells them that you know how to build scalable and robust software. Learning basic data structures and algorithms will also be helpful since many technical challenges involve them.

With that said, remote positions are more competitive as there are fewer of them and many engineers seek them. I can't promise anything, but I definitely think there is a very good chance for Launch School graduates to find remote work once they finish the Core Curriculum or Capstone. I know two Capstone grads who found 100% remote positions. Being remote friendly is a huge perk that more and more companies are realizing they can use to lure in great talent.

If remote work is what you are seeking after completing Launch School, I would strongly suggest creating an impressive portfolio. You will need to stand out from other strong candidates. Having non-trivial and robust projects on your GitHub will help make employers notice you. As well as writing on Medium and giving Meetup talks. Showcasing your knowledge will make up for your lack of job experience.
