#### Capstone project introduction

https://launchschool.com/capstone

**Purpose of capstone project**

The goal of the Capstone Program is to give students *an intense finishing experience that results in a career-launching job*


Because the end goal of Capstone is *very ambitious*, it requires in total 4 to 7+ months of full-time focus, and possibly even longer. The first 16 weeks will be classroom instruction Monday-Friday all day; after that, there will be a 1-3+ month Career Search process.


The Capstone Program is a transition away from Mastery-Based Learning with the goal of applying already-mastered fundamentals to higher level concepts. Participants will be exposed to *rigorous algorithmic thinking and problem solving* that top employers demand. This is the next step in your learning journey after mastering fundamentals.

**Payment policy**


The current Capstone fee is 18% of your first year salary or $18k, whichever is higher (we are targeting jobs that pay at least $100k)

Please note that while we do not foresee any upcoming changes, we reserve the right to change this number at any point (until you sign an *Income Share Agreement contract*). We collect a small downpayment, and you pay us the majority of the Capstone fee after you start your job and start making money. We can even issue no-interest loans up to $15,000 to participants who need it while going through Capstone. Previous Capstone participants have used loans to purchase new laptops, help them relocate, pay rent, eat meals, take people out for coffee, etc.

**Requirements**

- We're incentivized to help you compete for a top job at the best company possible, and *your goal should be the same*.
- You must be able to learn full-time, often during evenings and weekends. Time commitment will be a minimum of 40 to 60+ hours/week.
- You must be prepared to *work really, really hard*.


You must be legally able to work in the United States (US citizen or Permanent Resident).
You must reside in the United States.
You must be able to conduct the Career Search process in either New York City or San Francisco/Bay Area or an approved city. *Besides NYC and SFBA, we are also optimistic about Austin, Boston, Chicago, Denver, Los Angeles, Portland, Seattle, and Toronto.* If your city isn't listed above and you've done well on the assessments, please reach out and we can talk about it. Remember that when we consider admissions, *we look at both your performance as well as the location, so it's not possible for us to answer "will you consider city X?" type of questions without also seeing your performance in our assessments.*
You must have completed and mastered all the fundamental materials in the Launch School Core Curriculum, and you must have done well on all or vast majority of the assessments.
You must be available full-time for the entire duration of Capstone, including the Career Search phase which could last 3 months or longer.
You must have passed all assessments within the last 18 months. *If completion of an assessment has been over 18 months, then you have to retake that assessment.*

**Logistics**

There are two Capstone cohorts throughout the year, and the application deadline is typically about 1 month prior to the cohort start date.

Most applicants to Capstone are known to the admissions team many months in advance, and the cohort starts to form about 2 months prior to the cohort start date. You should be nearing the finish of the Core Curriculum about 1 to 2 months prior to the cohort start date to have a chance to participate in that cohort. This includes retaking any expired assessments.

**Admissions**

To increase your chances of being admitted, produce artifacts that can convince us of the above attributes. We can determine a lot of this from your *assessments* since most people have been at Launch School for years by the time they apply. But if you have great *writing samples* or recordings of you *speaking* in public, we want to see them. We also look at *well-received blog posts* or *threads/comments* that you've contributed over the years in the Launch School community and in the courses.
